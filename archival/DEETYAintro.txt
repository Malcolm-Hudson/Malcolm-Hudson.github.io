Subject:	Sampling methods for quality assurance

A SUMMARY OF RESPONSES WILL BE LISTED IN DUE COURSE.

I would appreciate feedback on the style of responses adopted
by various Universities in completing the DEETYA census of
Research Outputs and on a draft discussion document. 
If our School's response is indicative, the DEETYA census
was an extremely wasteful procedure in terms of academic staff time.
For example, in order to maximise our contribution to the
University's research quantum, 
our Head of School spent days checking every aspect of the
physical evidence proferred by staff in support of their publications.
It seems important to suggest an improved system before
unreasonable aspects of this bureaucracy become fixed.

As a step towards a proposal to be directed to AVCC,
a discussion paper has been prepared and may be viewed on
http://www.ocs.mq.edu.au/~mhudson/DEETYA.html
It proposes a sampling based plan for quality assurance.
This is prepared without any special knowledge except that
gleaned from public sources and apparent policies being
instituted. (If some of you have knowledge of current DEETYA plans,
please bring pertinent points to my notice).
I would be pleased to further refine the draft document in line 
with your comments.
