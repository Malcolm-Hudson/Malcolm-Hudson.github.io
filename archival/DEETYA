Dear Malcolm,
	Thanks for your message.  Yes, the exercise caused the same 
amount of work here, too.  It was quite extraordinary.  I understand 
that the issue of measuring research performance is likely to be one 
of the things on which the West Committee makes a recommendation.  A 
few months ago I spoke to a DVC for Research at a state university, 
who claimed to be "in the know" about future directions.  He said that 
he could not see the present use of publications data surviving much 
longer, if only because the data are so time-consuming and complex to 
gather.  I only hope he is right.  

	Kind regards

	Peter

Malcolm,

The principle of promoting a sampling method to DEETYA is an excellent one.

In our department (a mathematics department with about 30 staff plus many
research students) each staff member is responsible for producing the hard
evidence of refereeing etc for each of their own publications.  One member
of academic staff is then responsible for recording and filing this physical
evidence, as his main departmental committee duty.

Gordon

Dear Malcolm,
I strongly support the thrust of your discussion paper, as I'm aware, 
from discussions with colleagues in various institutions, just how 
much time has been consumed by this ridiculous exercise.  Can I 
suggest that non-statistical readers may find some of your argument 
heavy-going.  In particular, I think the third para could be 
expressed more simply.  The recommendations are plain enough though, 
and I hope they fall on sympathetic ears.
Regards
Judy
